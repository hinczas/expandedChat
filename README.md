# expandedChat
chat app expanding on written language limitations

Usage similar to basic chat app but allows to use markup in conversations:
CODE	Explanation	Example
\@	Reference any given topic	      : @T1 - references topic 1 without going into T1
\^	Reference previous statement	  : ^5 will reference a 5th statement up
\*	Correction	                    : as commonly used in chats
\#	Delete/cancell line	            : Sneaky to use sarcasm
\<	Delete/cancell last function character	
\>	jump to specific/new topic	    : >T2 jumps to topic 2; > jumps to / creates new topic
\~	more or less	
\%	Rename current topic	          : in T1, %T3 will replace T1 to T3
\\	Escape character	              : allows to use code as text without function
\|	EOF
